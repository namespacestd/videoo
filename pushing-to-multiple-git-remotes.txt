Pushing to multiple remote locations
------------------------------------
(from http://stackoverflow.com/a/3195446)

Modify your git config for the repo (using command "git config -e") so it looks something like this:

[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
        ignorecase = true
[remote "GitHub"]
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*
        url = https://github.com/namespacestd/videoo.git
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
[remote "Stash"]
        url = https://ase.cs.columbia.edu/stash/scm/team5/videeo.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/stash/*
[remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/namespacestd/videoo.git
        url = https://ase.cs.columbia.edu/stash/scm/team5/videeo.git

Then you can use the following command to push to both:
	git push origin master



To just push to stash
---------------------

[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
        url = https://ase.cs.columbia.edu/stash/scm/team5/videeo.git
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
